# Python Prep

This set of exercises is to help review some of the basic Python skills
required in our course.

To run your program at the command line, type:

`python python_prep.py`

If you're running in the Leap IDE simply click the green triangle in the top
right.

There are three parts to this review assignment.

## Exercise 1

In `exercise_1`, add up the numbers provided in the list S. This must be done
using a for-loop, and the sum should be returned by the function.

## Exercise 2

In `exercise_2`, add up the numbers provided in the list S *using at most two
lines of code*. The sum should be returned by the function.

## Exercise 3

In `exercise_3`, create a dictionary to store the values for the following list
of points when input to the function `f(x,y) = 8x + 3y`. For example, if your
dictionary is called `f` you should have an entry `f[(0,0)] = 0` and an entry
`f[(1,1)] = 11`, and so on. The dictionary should be returned by the function.

Points to include:

- (0, 0)
- (1, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 3)
- (4, 4)
- (5, 5)

Hint: Consider using a for-loop to run through the list of points.
